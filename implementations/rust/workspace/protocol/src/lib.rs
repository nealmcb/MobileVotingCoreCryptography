//! The core library for the VoteSecure project.
//!
//! This library provides a state machine implementation of the e-voting protocol
//! for the on-device Voting Application. It is designed to be integrated into
//! a host application that will provide the networking and user interface layers.
//!
//! The primary entry point is the `TopLevelActor`, which manages the state
//! for all subprotocols.

// --- Public Modules ---
// These modules contain the data structures that are passed to and from the actor.

// Disable unused imports warning as the crypto utils are used by the Vserializable macro but clippy can't figure that out.
